# Fruit Ninja

> Fruit Ninja is a mobile game developed by Halfbrick Studios that released in April 2010 on the iOS App Store. In Fruit Ninja, the player slices fruit with a blade controlled via the touch screen. As the fruit is thrown onto the screen, the player swipes their finger across the screen to create a slicing motion, attempting to slice the fruit in half.

# Fruit Ninja VR
This VR variation is created for research purposes. The main objective of this project is to measure and evaluate the impact of game effect elements, also known as juice or amplified feedback, on players' emotional and physiological responses. The players are presented with different stimuli by alternating the activation of effects. 

The effect elements include visual, haptic, and audio feedback related to different in-game events. These effects do not directly contribute to the game but may impact players' gaming experience.

The design of integration and in-game event mapping can be categorized into three groups: 
- input-based effects (sword effects, or labeled as ```movement``` or ```M```)
- action-based effects (item interaction effects, or labeled as ```feedback``` or ```F```)
- progress-based effects (combo effects, or labeled as ```gameplay``` or ```G```)

In the controlled basic condition, the indicator effects (labeled ```I```) and the ambient audio are activated.
